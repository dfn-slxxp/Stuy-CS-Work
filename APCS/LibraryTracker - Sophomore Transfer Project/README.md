## Using this Application using Gradle (Reccomended)

### Building the Application with Gradle
In the directory of the project, run
```bash
./gradlew build
```

### Running the Application with Gradle

1. In the directory of the project, run
    ```bash
    ./gradlew run
    ```
 
2. You will then be prompted to enter File Paths to your CSV files. The files will default to the test files in "app/src/main/resources".

## Using this Application manually using javac

### Compiling the Application using javac

1. In the directory of the project, run
    ```bash
    javac -d bin app/src/main/java/library/project/*.java app/src/main/java/library/project/Items/*.java
    ```

    This will compile the Java files into bin

2. In the same directory, run 
    ```bash
    cp app/src/main/resources/*.csv bin/
    ```

    This will copy the test CSVs into the bin directory as well. If you are using your own CSV files, run
    ```bash
    cp [Path to the folder containing your CSV files]/*csv bin
    ```

    This will copy *your* CSV files into bin

### Running the Application using javac

1. Simply run the Project's Librarian class using:
    ```bash
    java -cp bin library.project.Librarian
    ```
